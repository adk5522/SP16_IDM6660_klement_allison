			<h2>The Best Time of the Day</h2>

		<p> To me, there’s nothing like curling up with a good book before bed. It just might be the best feeling in the world. Except, of course, curling up with a good book… and my child. The day’s worries slip away as I concentrate on making each character come alive just by the sound of my voice. I feel my daughter relax beside me, and I hope that someday, she will remember ‘Book O’Clock’ as the best time of her day, too.

				<p>Some books are read just once, shelved and are forgotten. Some books are read a few times, admired and discussed, but once again, forgotten. And then there are the books that are read over and over, memorized by both reader and the listener, and sometimes even make their way into our dreams that night. These are a few of those books.
